It's very easy to get started with Fannypack. Just include a link to our css file in your `<head>` and you're good to go.

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fannypack.dpgmedia.net/css/fannypack.css" />
{% endhighlight %}

Next: start implementing the html.

## Where is feature X or Module Y?

Our goal is to keep Fannypack lightweight so we keep it to the basic modules.
If you need something feel free to submit pull requests or report any bugs in our [Github repo](https://github.com/depersgroep/fannypack).

## Where's the Javascript

We are developing a separate JS package known as **Buckle**. More info coming soon.
